- boardgamegeek2 library does not work with the latest python, its requests_cache.core is deprecated.
- We scrape the data from the website itself instead.
- Users exist on BoardGameGeek and have at least some rated games.
- If a game is not rated by a user, treat it as 0 or ignore it in similarity calculation.
- Only consider the first 100 games in the pages fetched by rating to limit computation.
- Similarity is based purely on ratings, not play count or other metadata.
